# Learning OpenGL

I always wanted to learn programming graphics without using shortcuts like SDL2 or raylib, so the obvious solution is to learn programming with OpenGL using the C programming language

I haven't progressed that much, *(mainly because of college, work and other projects)* but in only a few more months I'm sure this repo will have some usage for learning like I did, I hope

## Setting your environment

### Debian Linux under X11

```bash
./dependencies.sh
```

### Windows 10+

Install Visual Studio Community, load the `learnopenglwin.sln` file, hit F5 and hope for the best

If you get an error due to missing opengl32.lib and/or glfw3.lib, then you will have to get those binary files from somewhere

### Other platforms

If you are on any other platform, you are on your own

## Building and running

If you got here, probably you have the right dependencies, so just run

```bash
make
./a.out
```

Else, idk
