# Learning OpenGL

I always wanted to learn programming graphics without using shortcuts like SDL2 or raylib, so the obvious solution is to learn programming with OpenGL using the C programming language

I haven't progressed that much, *(mainly because of college, work and other projects)* but in only a few more months I'm sure this repo will have some usage for learning like I did, I hope

## Setting your environment

If you are on Debian Linux under X11

```bash
./dependencies.sh
```

If you are on any other platform, you are on your own

## Building and running

If you got here, probably you have the right dependencies, so just run

```bash
make
./a.out
```

Else, idk
